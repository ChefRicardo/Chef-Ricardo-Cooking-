# Chef-Ricardo-Cooking-
I Ricardo Campbell as Chef Ricardo was born in the beautiful Caribbean island of Jamaica W.I. I grew up in and around the busy hotels and restaurants of Ocho Rios, one of Jamaica's main tourist resort areas. Growing up as a young boy I had a keen interest in cooking. I spent a lot of time watching my elders cook many different dishes, especially my grandmother and father who loved cooking. My interest grew into a passion, after leaving school. I applied to be a kitchen assistant doing basic kitchen duties like preparing vegetables. Due to my eagerness I was given the opportunity to help prepare simple dishes like ackee and salt fish, rice and peas and brown stew chicken.
